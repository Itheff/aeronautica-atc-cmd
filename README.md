# About this Repository
This repository is a collection of two services. The first is a website that I am creating in case the main Aeronautica
ATC website at [atc.flysan.xyz](https://atc.flysan.xyz) is ever depreciated or shut down. The second is a Python tkinter
project that generates PDC clearances for controllers.

## Aeronautica ATC
Aeronautica is a [Roblox game](https://www.roblox.com/games/6647962258/Aeronautica) about flying many types of planes. 
This repository is for a sub-community of Aeronautica called Aeronautica ATC (AeroATC), focused on ATC roleplay.

## Website
The website is unfinished and will not be updated frequently. It's located in the website directory.

## PDC Generator
The PDC Generator is in a much more finished state (though not done yet). It will likely get updated whenever I
inevitably find a bug and might also get updated with new features from time to time. It is contained in a single
Python script under the app directory (app/app.py) and uses tkinter for the UI elements. Simply run the script with
python installed, insert a flight plan from the flight plans Google Sheet and then click the submit button, and the
program will create a PDC clearance for you. Open an issue on GitHub or DM me on discord (@itheff) for help and bug
reporting.
